# Category_Theory_Project

**Copyright © 2021 Alessio Borgi**

**PROJECT SCOPE**: Develop a Java Library to represent Category Theory Set. This project consists in an exploration of category theory concepts and their applications in computer science and mathematics, providing implementations, examples, and explanations of key category theory principles, making abstract mathematical ideas more accessible. Ideal for students, researchers, and developers interested in the theoretical foundations of programming and logic.
 
**PROJECT RESULTS**:
- User authentication.
- Graphical Interface (JavaFX & Java Swing-based).
- Six categories development: Semigroup, Monoid, Group, Ring, Set, and Vector Category. 
- Submenus and keyboard shortcuts implementation. 
- Java’s Threads to handle time and date.
- Nodes (Objects) and Morphisms graphical creation.
